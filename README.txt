This code is a basic implementation of the PSOLA pitch shifting algorithm. 
It can change the pitch, time, and formant of an input signal independently of one another. 
PSOLA works best on monophonic tonal input. 

Requires the MATLAB Audio ToolBox to run. 

Run from the demoPSOLA.m file.
1) Place the desired audio file into the working directory.
2) Set the fullFileName variable equal to your file's filename.
3) Set the semitones, timeStretch, and formantShift variables to taste.
